# Nocturna (WIP)
An on-browser smart dark mode system powered by computer vision.

This repository contains the code and resources for training and deploying the Nocturna model, which classifies images as suitable or not suitable for dark mode inversion. We utilize a custom dataset with a state-of-the-art MobileNetV3 architecture to achieve high accuracy in image classification tasks.

## Current Status
- Model training and evaluation scripts are available.
- Dataset structure and loading mechanisms are implemented.
- Model trained with AdamW optimizer and ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler, achieving a 98.5% accuracy on the validation set.
- Further improvements and optimizations are ongoing.
